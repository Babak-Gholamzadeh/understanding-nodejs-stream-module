# Conclusion

The `stream` module is counted as one of the most complex modules in Node.js, but also at the same time, this module is considered the heart of built-in modules, because there are some important modules that depend on it.

Therefore, because of these reasons, maintaining and developing this module is nearly difficult. As you might have noticed through the reading of this book, there are some methods and properties or even some behaviors that just remain in this module only because of the backward compatibility reason – there is more stuff like them in the built-in stream module that we just ignore them here.

In this book, for the reason of giving you an abstract view of this module, we just experienced some part of it.

But now that you have a vision of this module, perhaps you can dive into it more deeply by yourself to comprehend this module or even to have a better understanding of Node.js.
